											<p>
												These terms and conditions
												(&quot;Agreement&quot;) set
												forth the general terms and
												conditions of your use of the
												&quot;WikiDocs&quot; mobile
												application (&quot;Mobile
												Application&quot; or
												&quot;Service&quot;) and any of
												its related products and
												services (collectively,
												&quot;Services&quot;). This
												Agreement is legally binding
												between you (&quot;User&quot;,
												&quot;you&quot; or
												&quot;your&quot;) and this
												Mobile Application developer
												(&quot;Operator&quot;,
												&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;
												or &quot;our&quot;). By
												accessing and using the Mobile
												Application and Services, you
												acknowledge that you have read,
												understood, and agree to be
												bound by the terms of this
												Agreement. If you are entering
												into this Agreement on behalf of
												a business or other legal
												entity, you represent that you
												have the authority to bind such
												entity to this Agreement, in
												which case the terms
												&quot;User&quot;,
												&quot;you&quot; or
												&quot;your&quot; shall refer to
												such entity. If you do not have
												such authority, or if you do not
												agree with the terms of this
												Agreement, you must not accept
												this Agreement and may not
												access and use the Mobile
												Application and Services. You
												acknowledge that this Agreement
												is a contract between you and
												the Operator, even though it is
												electronic and is not physically
												signed by you, and it governs
												your use of the Mobile
												Application and Services.
											</p>
											<h4>Accounts and membership</h4>
											<p>
												If you create an account in the
												Mobile Application, you are
												responsible for maintaining the
												security of your account and you
												are fully responsible for all
												activities that occur under the
												account and any other actions
												taken in connection with it. We
												may, but have no obligation to,
												monitor and review new accounts
												before you may sign in and start
												using the Services. Providing
												false contact information of any
												kind may result in the
												termination of your account. You
												must immediately notify us of
												any unauthorized uses of your
												account or any other breaches of
												security. We will not be liable
												for any acts or omissions by
												you, including any damages of
												any kind incurred as a result of
												such acts or omissions. We may
												suspend, disable, or delete your
												account (or any part thereof) if
												we determine that you have
												violated any provision of this
												Agreement or that your conduct
												or content would tend to damage
												our reputation and goodwill. If
												we delete your account for the
												foregoing reasons, you may not
												re-register for our Services. We
												may block your email address and
												Internet protocol address to
												prevent further registration.
											</p>
											<h4>User content</h4>
											<p>
												We do not own any data,
												information or material
												(collectively,
												&quot;Content&quot;) that you
												submit in the Mobile Application
												in the course of using the
												Service. You shall have sole
												responsibility for the accuracy,
												quality, integrity, legality,
												reliability, appropriateness,
												and intellectual property
												ownership or right to use of all
												submitted Content. We may, but
												have no obligation to, monitor
												and review the Content in the
												Mobile Application submitted or
												created using our Services by
												you. You grant us permission to
												access, copy, distribute, store,
												transmit, reformat, display and
												perform the Content of your user
												account solely as required for
												the purpose of providing the
												Services to you. Without
												limiting any of those
												representations or warranties,
												we have the right, though not
												the obligation, to, in our own
												sole discretion, refuse or
												remove any Content that, in our
												reasonable opinion, violates any
												of our policies or is in any way
												harmful or objectionable. Unless
												specifically permitted by you,
												your use of the Mobile
												Application and Services does
												not grant us the license to use,
												reproduce, adapt, modify,
												publish or distribute the
												Content created by you or stored
												in your user account for
												commercial, marketing or any
												similar purpose.
											</p>
											<h4>Backups</h4>
											<p>
												We perform regular backups of
												the Content, however, these
												backups are for our own
												administrative purposes only and
												are in no way guaranteed. You
												are responsible for maintaining
												your own backups of your data.
												We do not provide any sort of
												compensation for lost or
												incomplete data in the event
												that backups do not function
												properly. We will do our best to
												ensure complete and accurate
												backups, but assume no
												responsibility for this duty.
											</p>
											<h4>Links to other resources</h4>
											<p>
												Although the Mobile Application
												and Services may link to other
												resources (such as websites,
												mobile applications, etc.), we
												are not, directly or indirectly,
												implying any approval,
												association, sponsorship,
												endorsement, or affiliation with
												any linked resource, unless
												specifically stated herein. We
												are not responsible for
												examining or evaluating, and we
												do not warrant the offerings of,
												any businesses or individuals or
												the content of their resources.
												We do not assume any
												responsibility or liability for
												the actions, products, services,
												and content of any other third
												parties. You should carefully
												review the legal statements and
												other conditions of use of any
												resource which you access
												through a link in the Mobile
												Application and Services. Your
												linking to any other off-site
												resources is at your own risk.
											</p>

												set forth in the Agreement, you

												purpose; (b) to solicit others
												to perform or participate in any
												unlawful acts; (c) to violate
												any international, federal,
												provincial or state regulations,
												rules, laws, or local
												ordinances; (d) to infringe upon
												or violate our intellectual
												property rights or the
												intellectual property rights of
												others; (e) to harass, abuse,
												insult, harm, defame, slander,
												disparage, intimidate, or
												discriminate based on gender,

												submit false or misleading
												information; (g) to upload or

												Application and Services for
												violating any of the prohibited
												uses.
											</p>
											<h4>
												Intellectual property rights
											</h4>
											<p>
												&quot;Intellectual Property
												Rights&quot; means all present
												and future rights conferred by
												statute, common law or equity in
												or in relation to any copyright
												and related rights, trademarks,
												designs, patents, inventions,
												goodwill and the right to sue
												for passing off, rights to
												inventions, rights to use, and
												all other intellectual property
												rights, in each case whether
												registered or unregistered and
												including all applications and
												rights to apply for and be
												granted, rights to claim
												priority from, such rights and
												all similar or equivalent rights
												or forms of protection and any
												other results of intellectual
												activity which subsist or will
												subsist now or in the future in
												any part of the world. This
												Agreement does not transfer to
												you any intellectual property
												owned by the Operator or third
												parties, and all rights, titles,
												and interests in and to such
												property will remain (as between
												the parties) solely with the
												Operator. All trademarks,
												service marks, graphics and
												logos used in connection with
												the Mobile Application and
												Services, are trademarks or
												registered trademarks of the
												Operator or its licensors. Other
												trademarks, service marks,
												graphics and logos used in
												connection with the Mobile
												Application and Services may be
												the trademarks of other third
												parties. Your use of the Mobile
												Application and Services grants
												you no right or license to
												reproduce or otherwise use any
												of the Operator or third party
												trademarks.
											</p>
											<h4>Limitation of liability</h4>
											<p>
												To the fullest extent permitted
												by applicable law, in no event
												will the Operator, its
												affiliates, directors, officers,
												employees, agents, suppliers or
												licensors be liable to any
												person for any indirect,
												incidental, special, punitive,
												cover or consequential damages
												(including, without limitation,
												damages for lost profits,
												revenue, sales, goodwill, use of
												content, impact on business,
												business interruption, loss of
												anticipated savings, loss of
												business opportunity) however
												caused, under any theory of
												liability, including, without
												limitation, contract, tort,
												warranty, breach of statutory
												duty, negligence or otherwise,
												even if the liable party has
												been advised as to the
												possibility of such damages or
												could have foreseen such
												damages. To the maximum extent
												permitted by applicable law, the
												aggregate liability of the
												Operator and its affiliates,
												officers, employees, agents,
												suppliers and licensors relating
												to the services will be limited
												to an amount greater of one
												dollar or any amounts actually
												paid in cash by you to the
												Operator for the prior one month
												period prior to the first event
												or occurrence giving rise to
												such liability. The limitations
												and exclusions also apply if
												this remedy does not fully
												compensate you for any losses or
												fails of its essential purpose.
											</p>
											<h4>Indemnification</h4>
											<p>
												You agree to indemnify and hold
												the Operator and its affiliates,
												directors, officers, employees,
												agents, suppliers and licensors
												harmless from and against any
												liabilities, losses, damages or
												costs, including reasonable
												attorneys' fees, incurred in
												connection with or arising from
												any third party allegations,
												claims, actions, disputes, or
												demands asserted against any of
												them as a result of or relating
												to your Content, your use of the
												Mobile Application and Services
												or any willful misconduct on
												your part.
											</p>
											<h4>Severability</h4>
											<p>
												All rights and restrictions
												contained in this Agreement may
												be exercised and shall be
												applicable and binding only to
												the extent that they do not
												violate any applicable laws and
												are intended to be limited to
												the extent necessary so that
												they will not render this
												Agreement illegal, invalid or
												unenforceable. If any provision
												or portion of any provision of
												this Agreement shall be held to
												be illegal, invalid or
												unenforceable by a court of
												competent jurisdiction, it is
												the intention of the parties
												that the remaining provisions or
												portions thereof shall
												constitute their agreement with
												respect to the subject matter
												hereof, and all such remaining
												provisions or portions thereof
												shall remain in full force and
												effect.
											</p>
